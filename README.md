## Abstract

Existing verifiable e-sortition systems are impractical due to computationally expensive verification (linear to the duration of the registration phase, T) or the ease of being denial of service. Based on the advance in verifiable delay functions, we propose a verifiable e-sortition scheme whose result can be efficiently verified in constant time with respect to T. We present the preliminary design and implementation, and explore future directions to further enhance practicability.
